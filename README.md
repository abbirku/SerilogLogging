# SerilogLogging

### Package: Serilog.AspNetCore 3.4.0
### Notes:
1. While using Serilog use appsetting.json for logging configuration.
2. It's a good practice to use logging in a single controller. 
3. Don't show error messages or exception to user. Log it down to Serilog file.
4. Don't make file extension as .txt, instead use a different custom extension.
